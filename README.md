# Maestro Scratch

## Introduction
Maestro Scratch is an open-source project that runs on the Scratch 3.0 interface and includes both official and experimental extensions. This project is designed to meet the educational needs of Hong Kong, promoting computer science education in primary and secondary schools, as well as in community centers and welfare organizations. Built upon the foundational principles of Scratch 3.0, it emphasizes adapting and enhancing the platform to meet local needs. We drew inspiration from various regional practices to create a version that reflects the unique characteristics and requirements of our community.

In addition, the development of Maestro Scratch aligns with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by UNESCO, aiming to empower learners to explore and tackle real-world challenges through innovative technology and creativity.
